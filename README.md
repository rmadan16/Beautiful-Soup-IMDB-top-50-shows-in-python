# Beautiful-Soup-IMDB-top-50-shows-in-python

This python program will find out Top 50 shows between 2 dates.
The program asks the user for Dates and prints Top 50 shows with maximum rating based on the time period given by you.

Please note - 
1. This project is for experimental use only and in no intention it must be used to scrap data from IMDB for whatever purposes.
2. Be generous in making the script calls strictly keeping in < 1 request per second.
3. Read creative licences on www.imdb.com before.



For ex - 
If I select dates as

From : 2018-03-01 (YYYY-MM-DD)
To : 2019-03 -01 

I get this on IMDB - 
https://www.imdb.com/search/title?release_date=2018-03-01,2019-03-01
